===== [[name]]NAME

rtapi_delay -- Busy-loop for short delays



===== [[syntax]]SYNTAX
void rtapi_delay(long int __nsec__)
void rtapi_delay_max()



===== [[arguments]]ARGUMENTS
.IP __nsec__
The desired delay length in nanoseconds



===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
**rtapi_delay** is a simple delay.  It is intended only for short
delays, since it simply loops, wasting CPU cycles.

**rtapi_delay_max** returns the max delay permitted (usually
approximately 1/4 of the clock period).  Any call to **rtapi_delay**
requesting a delay longer than the max will delay for the max time only.

**rtapi_delay_max** should be called before using **rtapi_delay** to
make sure the required delays can be achieved.  The actual resolution
of the delay may be as good as one nano-second, or as bad as a several
microseconds.



===== [[realtime considerations]]REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
May be called from init/cleanup code, and from within realtime tasks.



===== [[return value]]RETURN VALUE
**rtapi_delay_max returns the maximum delay permitted.
