===== [[name]]NAME

rtapi_div_u64 -- unsigned division of a 64-bit number by a 32-bit number



===== [[syntax]]SYNTAX
__u64 rtapi_div_u64_rem(__u64 __dividend__, __u32 __divisor__, __u32 *__remainder__)
__u64 rtapi_div_u64(__u64 __dividend__, __u32 __divisor__)
__s64 rtapi_div_s64(__s64 __dividend__, __s32 __divisor__)
__s64 rtapi_div_s64_rem(__s64 __dividend__, __s32 __divisor__, __s32 *__remainder__)



===== [[arguments]]ARGUMENTS
.IP __dividend__
The value to be divided
.IP __divisor__
The value to divide by
.IP __remainder__
Pointer to the location to store the remainder.  This may not be a NULL
pointer.  If the remainder is not desired, call **rtapi_div_u64** or
**rtapi_div_s64**.



===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
Perform integer division (and optionally compute the remainder) with a 64-bit dividend and 32-bit divisor.



===== [[return value]]RETURN VALUE
The result of integer division of __dividend / divisor__.  In versions with the __remainder__ argument, the remainder is stored in the pointed-to location.



===== [[notes]]NOTES
If the result of the division does not fit in the return type, the result is
undefined.

This function exists because in kernel space the use of the division operator
on a 64-bit type can lead to an undefined symbol such as __umoddi3 when the
module is loaded.



===== [[realtime considerations]]REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
May be called from init/cleanup code and from within realtime tasks.
Available in userspace components.
