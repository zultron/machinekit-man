===== [[name]]NAME

clarke2 -- Two input version of Clarke transform


===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
loadrt clarke2 [count=__N__**|names=**__name1__**[,**__name2...__**]]
**

===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION

The Clarke transform can be used to translate a vector
quantity from a three phase system (three components 120 degrees
apart) to a two phase Cartesian system.
.P
**clarke2** implements
a special case of the Clarke transform, which only needs two of the
three input phases.  In a three wire three phase system, the sum of the
three phase currents or voltages must always be zero.  As a result only
two of the three are needed to completely define the current or voltage.
**clarke2** assumes that the sum is zero, so it only uses phases A and
B of the input.  Since the H (homopolar) output will always be zero in
this case, it is not generated.
