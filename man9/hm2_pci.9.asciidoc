===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION

hm2_pci is a device driver that interfaces Mesa's PCI and PC-104/Plus
based Anything I/O boards (with the HostMot2 firmware) to the LinuxCNC
HAL.

The supported boards are: the 5i20, 5i22, and 5i23 (all on PCI); the
4i65 and 4i68 (on PC-104/Plus), and the 3x20 (on PCI Express, probably
using a 6i68 or 7i68 carrier card).

The driver programs the board's FPGA with firmware when it registers
the board with the hostmot2 driver.  The firmware to load is specified
in the **config** modparam, as described in the hostmot2(9) manpage,
in the __config modparam__ section.
