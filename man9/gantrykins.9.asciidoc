===== [[name]]NAME

gantrykins -- A kinematics module that maps one axis to multiple joints



===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
loadrt gantrykins coordinates=__axisletters
__
.SS Specifying gantry joint mapping via loadrt
The **coordinates=** parameter specifies the initial gantry joint mapping.
Each axis letter is mapped to a joint, starting from 0.  So
**coordinates=XYYZ** maps the X axis to joint 0, the Y axis to joint 1 and 2,
and the Z axis to joint 3.  If not specified, the default mapping is
**coordinates=XYZABC**.  Coordinate letters may be specified in uppercase
or lowercase.

.SS A note about joints and axes
LinuxCNC makes a distinction between joints and axes: a joint is something
controlled by a motor, and an axis is a coordinate you can move via
G-code.  You can also jog joints or jog axes.

A gantry has two joints controlling one axis, and this requires a bit
of special care.

Homing always happens in joint mode (aka Free mode).  The two joints
of a gantry's axis must be homed together, so they must have the same
[AXIS_n]HOME_SEQUENCE in the .ini file.

Jogging of a gantry must happen in world mode (aka Teleop mode).
If you jog a gantry in joint mode (Free mode), you will move just one
of the joints, and the gantry will rack.  In contrast, if you jog a
gantry in world mode (Teleop mode), it's the axis that jogs: linuxcnc
will coordinate the motion of the two joints that make up the axis,
both joints will move together, and the gantry will stay square.

The Axis GUI has provisions for jogging in joint mode (Free) and in
world mode (Teleop).  Use the "$" hotkey, or the View menu to switch
between them.

Joint-mode (aka Free mode) supports continuous and incremental jogging.
World-mode (aka Teleop mode) only supports continuous jogging.



===== [[kinematics]]KINEMATICS
In the inverse kinematics, each joint gets the value of its corresponding axis.
In the forward kinematics, each axis gets the value of the highest numbered
corresponding joint.  For example, with **coordinates=XYYZ** the Y axis
position comes from joint 2, not joint 1.



===== [[functions]]FUNCTIONS
None.  



===== [[pins]]PINS
None.



===== [[parameters]]PARAMETERS

gantrykins.joint-__N__ (s32)
Specifies the axis mapped to joint __N__.  The values 0 through
8 correspond to the axes XYZABCUVW.  It is preferable to use the
"coordinates=" parameter at loadrt-time rather than setting the joint-N
parameters later, because the gantrykins module prints the joint-to-axis
mapping at loadrt-time, and having that output correct is nice.

**gantrykins** must be loaded before **motion**.
