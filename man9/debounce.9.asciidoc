===== [[name]]NAME

debounce -- filter noisy digital inputs


===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
loadrt debounce cfg=__size[,size,...]__**
**.P
Creates filter groups each with the given number of filters (__size__).  Each
filter group has the same sample rate and delay.



===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
The debounce filter works by incrementing a counter whenever the input is true,
and decrementing the counter when it is false.  If the counter decrements to
zero, the output is set false and the counter ignores further decrements.  If
the counter increments up to a threshold, the output is set true and the
counter ignores further increments.  If the counter is between zero and the
threshold, the output retains its previous state.  The threshold determines the
amount of filtering: a threshold of 1 does no filtering at all, and a threshold
of N requires a signal to be present for N samples before the output changes
state.  



===== [[functions]]FUNCTIONS

debounce.__G__
Sample all the input pins in group G and update the output pins.


===== [[pins]]PINS

debounce.__G__**.**__F__**.in** bit in
The F'th input pin in group G.  

debounce.__G__**.**__F__**.out** bit out
The F'th output pin in group G.  Reflects the last "stable" input seen on the
corresponding input pin.

debounce.__G__**.delay** signed rw
Sets the amount of filtering for all pins in group G.
