===== [[name]]NAME
iocontrol -- accepts NML I/O commands, interacts with HAL in userspace



===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
**loadusr io [-ini **__inifile__**]
**



===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
These pins are created by the userspace IO controller, usually found in $LINUXCNC_HOME/bin/io
.P
The signals are turned on and off in userspace - if you have strict timing requirements or simply need more i/o, consider using the realtime synchronized i/o provided by **motion**(9) instead.
.P
The inifile is searched for in the directory from which halcmd was run, unless an absolute path is specified.
