===== [[name]]NAME
halcmd -- manipulate the LinuxCNC HAL from the command line


===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
halcmd
[__OPTIONS__] [__COMMAND__ [__ARG__]]
.PP


===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
**halcmd** is used to manipulate the HAL (Hardware Abstraction
Layer) from the command line.  **halcmd** can optionally read
commands from a file, allowing complex HAL configurations to be
set up with a single command.

If the **readline** library is available when LinuxCNC is compiled, then
**halcmd** offers commandline editing and completion when running
interactively.  Use the up arrow to recall previous commands, and press tab to
complete the names of items such as pins and signals.


===== [[options]]OPTIONS

**-I**
Before tearing down the realtime environment, run an interactive halcmd.
**halrun** only.  If **-I** is used, it must precede all other
commandline arguments.

**--f** [__file__]
Ignore commands on command line, take input from __file__
instead.  If __file__ is not specified, take input from
__stdin__.

**-i **__inifile__
Use variables from __inifile__ for substitutions.  See **SUBSTITUTION**
below.

**--k**
Keep going after failed command(s).  The default is to stop
and return failure if any command fails.

**--q**
display errors only (default)

**--Q**
display nothing, execute commands silently

**--s**
Script-friendly mode.  In this mode, __show__ will not output titles for the items
shown.  Also, module names will be printed instead of ID codes in pin, param, and funct
listings.  Threads are printed on a single line, with the thread period, FP usage and
name first, followed by all of the functions in the thread, in execution order.  Signals
are printed on a single line, with the type, value, and signal name first, followed by
a list of pins connected to the signal, showing both the direction and the pin name.
No prompt will be printed if both **-s** and **-f** are specified.

**-R**
Release the HAL mutex.  This is useful for recovering when a HAL component has crashed
while holding the HAL mutex.

**--v**
display results of each command

**--V**
display lots of debugging junk

**--h** [__command__]
display a help screen and exit, displays extended help on __command__ if specified


===== [[commands]]COMMANDS
Commands tell **halcmd** what to do.  Normally **halcmd**
reads a single command from the command line and executes it.
If the '**-f**' option is used to read commands from a file,
**halcmd** reads each line of the file as a new command.
Anything following '**#**' on a line is a comment.

**loadrt** __modname__
(__load__ __r__eal__t__ime module)  Loads a realtime HAL
module called __modname__.  **halcmd** looks for the module
in a directory specified at compile time.

In systems with realtime, **halcmd** calls the
**linuxcnc_module_helper** to load realtime modules.
**linuxcnc_module_helper** is a setuid program and is compiled with
a whitelist of modules it is allowed to load.  This is currently
just a list of **LinuxCNC**-related modules.  The
**linuxcnc_module_helper** execs insmod, so return codes and error
messages are those from insmod.  Administrators who wish to
restrict which users can load these **LinuxCNC**-related kernel
modules can do this by setting the permissions and group on
**linuxcnc_module_helper** appropriately.

In systems without realtime **halcmd** calls the
**rtapi_app** which creates the simulated realtime environment
if it did not yet exist, and then loads the requested component
with a call to **dlopen(3)**.

**unloadrt** __modname__
(__unload__ __r__eal__t__ime module)  Unloads a realtime HAL
module called __modname__.  If __modname__ is "all", it will
unload all currently loaded realtime HAL modules.  **unloadrt**
also works by execing **linuxcnc_module_helper** or **rtapi_app**, just like
**loadrt**.

**loadusr** __[flags]__ __unix-command__
(__load__ __Us__e__r__space component) Executes the given
__unix-command__, usually to load a userspace component.
__[flags]__ may be one or more of:
.RS
.IP \(bu 4
**-W** to wait for the component to become ready.  The component
is assumed to have the same name as the first argument of the command.
.IP \(bu 4
**-Wn name** to wait for the component, which will have the given
name.
.IP \(bu 4
**-w** to wait for the program to exit
.IP \(bu 4
**-i** to ignore the program return value (with -w)
.RE

**waitusr** __[-i]__  __name__
(__wait__ for __Us__e__r__space component) Waits for user
space component __name__ to disconnect from HAL (usually on exit).
If the component is not loaded, or exited already, waitusr will fail the halcmd script with
a nonzero exit status. This can be suppressed using the __[-i]__ flag.
Usefull near the end of a
HAL file to wait until the user closes some user interface component
before cleaning up and exiting.

**unloadusr** __compname__
(__unload__ __Us__e__r__space component)  Unloads a userspace
component called __compname__.  If __compname__ is "all", it will
unload all userspace components.  **unloadusr**
works by sending SIGTERM to all userspace components.

**unload** __compname__
Unloads a userspace component or realtime module.  If __compname__ is "all",
it will unload all userspace components and realtime modules.

**newsig** __signame__ __type__
(OBSOLETE - use **net** instead) (__new__ __sig__nal)
Creates a new HAL signal called __signame__ that may later
be used to connect two or more HAL component pins.  __type__
is the data type of the new signal, and must be one of "**bit**",
"**s32**", "**u32**", or "**float**".
Fails if a signal of the same name already exists.

**delsig** __signame__
(__del__ete __sig__nal)  Deletes HAL signal __signame__.
Any pins currently linked to the signal will be unlinked.
Fails if __signame__ does not exist.

**sets** __signame__ __value__
(__set__ __s__ignal)  Sets the value of signal __signame__
to __value__.  Fails if __signame__ does not exist, if it
already has a writer, or if __value__ is not a legal value.
Legal values depend on the signals's type.

**stype** __name__
(__s__ignal type)  Gets the type of signal
__name__.  Fails if __name__ does not exist as a signal.

**gets** __signame__
(__get__ __s__ignal)  Gets the value of signal __signame__.  Fails
if __signame__ does not exist.

**linkps** __pinname__ [__arrow__] __signame__
(OBSOLETE - use **net** instead) (__link__ __p__in to __s__ignal)
Establishs a link between a HAL component pin __pinname__ and
a HAL signal __signame__.  Any previous link to __pinname__ will be
broken.  __arrow__ can be "**=>**", "**<=**", "**<=>**",
or omitted.  **halcmd** ignores arrows, but they can be useful
in command files to document the direction of data flow.  Arrows
should not be used on the command line since the shell might try
to interpret them.  Fails if either __pinname__ or __signame__
does not exist, or if they are not the same type type.

**linksp** __signame__ [__arrow__] __pinname__
(OBSOLETE - use **net** instead) (__link__ __s__ignal to __p__in)
Works like **linkps** but reverses the order of the arguments.
**halcmd** treats both link commands exactly the same.  Use whichever
you prefer.

**linkpp** __pinname1__ [__arrow__] __pinname2__
(OBSOLETE - use **net** instead) (__link__ __p__in to __p__in)
Shortcut for **linkps** that creates the signal (named like the
first pin), then links them both to that signal.  **halcmd** treats
this just as if it were:
   **halcmd** **newsig** pinname1 
   **halcmd** **linksp** pinname1 pinname1
   **halcmd** **linksp** pinname1 pinname2

**net** __signame__ __pinname__ __...__
Create __signname__ to match the type of __pinname__ if it does not yet
exist.  Then, link __signame__ to each __pinname__ in turn.  Arrows may
be used as in **linkps**. When linking a pin to a signal for the first
time, the signal value will inherit the pin's default value.


**unlinkp** __pinname__
(__unlink__ __p__in)  Breaks any previous link to __pinname__.
Fails if __pinname__ does not exist. An unlinked pin will retain the last
value of the signal it was linked to.


**setp** __name__ __value__
(__set__ __p__arameter or __p__in)  Sets the value of parameter or pin
__name__ to __value__.  Fails if __name__ does not exist as a pin or
parameter, if it is a parameter that is not writable, if it is a pin that is an
output, if it is a pin that is already attached to a signal, or if __value__
is not a legal value.  Legal values depend on the type of the pin or parameter.
If a pin and a parameter both exist with the given name, the parameter is acted
on.

__paramname__ **=** __value__

__pinname__ **=** __value__
Identical to **setp**.  This alternate form of the command may
be more convenient and readable when used in a file.

**ptype** __name__
(__p__arameter or __p__in __type__)  Gets the type of parameter or
pin __name__.  Fails if __name__ does not exist as a pin or
parameter.  If a pin and a parameter both exist with the given name, the
parameter is acted on.

**getp** __name__
(__get__ __p__arameter or __p__in)  Gets the value of parameter or
pin __name__.  Fails if __name__ does not exist as a pin or
parameter.  If a pin and a parameter both exist with the given name, the
parameter is acted on.

**addf** __functname__ __threadname__
(__add__ __f__unction)  Adds function __functname__ to realtime
thread __threadname__.  __functname__ will run after any functions
that were previously added to the thread.  Fails if either
__functname__ or __threadname__ does not exist, or if they
are incompatible.

**delf** __functname__ __threadname__
(__del__ete __f__unction)  Removes function __functname__ from
realtime thread __threadname__.  Fails if either __functname__ or
__threadname__ does not exist, or if __functname__ is not currently
part of __threadname__.

**start**
Starts execution of realtime threads.  Each thread periodically calls
all of the functions that were added to it with the **addf** command,
in the order in which they were added.

**stop**
Stops execution of realtime threads.  The threads will no longer call
their functions.

**sleep** [__seconds__]
Pause the halcmd script for the specified time.

**show** [__item__]
Prints HAL items to __stdout__ in human readable format.
__item__ can be one of "**comp**" (components), "**pin**",
"**sig**" (signals), "**param**" (parameters), "**funct**"
(functions), "**thread**", or "**alias**".  The type "**all**"
can be used to show matching items of all the preceeding types.
If __item__ is omitted, **show** will print everything.

**item**
This is equivalent to **show all [item]**.

**save** [__item__]
Prints HAL items to __stdout__ in the form of HAL commands.
These commands can be redirected to a file and later executed
using **halcmd -f** to restore the saved configuration.
__item__ can be one of the following: "**comp**" generates
a **loadrt** command for realtime component.  "**sig**" 
generates a **newsig** command for each signal, and "**sigu**" generates a
**newsig** command for each unlinked signal (for use with **netl** and
**netla**).  "**link**" and "**linka**" both generate **linkps**
commands for each link. (**linka** includes arrows, while **link** does
not.) "**net**" and "**neta**" both generate one **newsig** command for
each signal, followed by **linksp** commands for each pin linked to that
signal.  (**neta** includes arrows.) "**netl**" generates one **net**
command for each linked signal, and "**netla**" generates a similar command
using arrows.  "**param**" generates one **setp** command for each
parameter.  "**thread**" generates one **addf** command for each function
in each realtime thread.  If __item__ is omitted, **save** does the
equivalent of **comp**, **sigu**, **link**, **param**, and **thread**.

**source**  __filename.hal__
Execute the commands from __filename.hal__.

**alias** __type__ __name__ __alias__
Assigns "**alias**" as a second name for the pin or parameter
"name".  For most operations, an alias provides a second
name that can be used to refer to a pin or parameter, both the
original name and the alias will work.
   "type" must be **pin** or **param**.
   "name" must be an existing name or **alias** of the specified type.

**unalias** __type__ __alias__
Removes any alias from the pin or parameter alias.
  "type" must be **pin** or **param**
  "alias" must be an existing name or **alias** of the specified type.

**list** __type__ [__pattern__]
  Prints the names of HAL items of the specified type.
  'type' is '**comp**', '**pin**', '**sig**', '**param**', '**funct**', or
  '**thread**'.  If 'pattern' is specified it prints only
  those names that match the pattern, which may be a
  'shell glob'.
  For '**sig**', '**pin**' and '**param**', the first pattern may be
  -t**datatype** where datatype is the data type (e.g., 'float')
  in this case, the listed pins, signals, or parameters
  are restricted to the given data type
  Names are printed on a single line, space separated.

**lock** [__all__|__tune__|__none__]
  Locks HAL to some degree.
  none - no locking done.
  tune - some tuning is possible (**setp** & such).
  all  - HAL completely locked.

**unlock** [__all__|__tune__]
  Unlocks HAL to some degree.
  tune - some tuning is possible (**setp** & such).
  all  - HAL completely unlocked.

**status** [__type__]
  Prints status info about HAL.
  'type' is '**lock**', '**mem**', or '**all**'.
  If 'type' is omitted, it assumes '**all**'.

**help** [__command__]
  Give help information for command.
  If 'command' is omitted, list command and brief description


===== [[substitution]]SUBSTITUTION
