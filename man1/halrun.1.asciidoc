===== [[name]]NAME
halrun -- manipulate the LinuxCNC HAL from the command line


===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
halrun __-h__
.PP
halrun [__-I__] [__halcmd_opts__] [__filename[.hal|.tcl]__]
.PP
halrun __-T__ [__halcmd_opts__] [__filename[.hal|.tcl]__]
.PP
halrun __-U__


===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
**halrun** is a convenience script used to manipulate the HAL (Hardware
Abstraction Layer) from the command line.  When invoked, **halrun**:

    Sets up the realtime environment.
    Executes a command interpreter (**halcmd** or **haltcl**).
    (Optionally) runs an interactive session.
    Tears down the realtime environment.

    If no filename is specified, an interactive session is started.
    The session will use **halcmd**(1) unless -T is specified in
    which case **haltcl**(1) will be used.

    If a filename is specifed and neither the -I nor the -T option
    is included, the filename will be processed by the command
    interpreter corresponding to the filename extension (**halcmd**
    or **haltcl**).  After processing, the realtime environment
    will be torn down.

    If a filename is specifed and the -I or -T option is included,
    the file is processed by the appropriate command interpreter and
    then an interactive session is started for **halcmd** or
    **haltcl** according to the -I or -T option.



===== [[options]]OPTIONS

**halcmd_opts**
When a .hal file is specifed, the **halcmd_opts** are
passed to **halcmd**.  See the man page for **halcmd**(1).
When a .tcl file is specified, the only valid options are:
    -i inifile
    -f filename[.tcl|.hal]  (alternate means of specifying a file)

**-I**
Run an interactive **halcmd** session

**-T**
Run an interactive **haltcl** session.

**-U**
Forcibly cause the realtime environment to exit.  It releases the HAL mutex,
requests that all HAL components unload, and stops the realtime system.
**-U** must be the only commandline argument.

**--h**
display a brief help screen and exit
