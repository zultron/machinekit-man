===== [[name]]NAME
gladevcp -- Virtual Control Panel for LinuxCNC based on Glade, Gtk and HAL widgets


===== [[synopsis]]SYNOPSIS
**gladevcp** [-g __WxH+X+Y__] [-c __component-name__] [-u __handler__] [-U __useroption__] [-H __halfile__] [-d] __myfile.ui__


===== [[options]]OPTIONS

**-g** __WxH+X+Y__
This sets the initial geometry of the root window.
Use 'WxH' for just size, '+X+Y' for just position, or 'WxH+X+Y' for both.
Size / position use pixel units. Position is referenced from top left. 

**-c** __component-name__
Use __component-name__ as the HAL component name.  If the component name is
not specified, the basename of the ui file is used.

**-u** __handler__
Instructs gladevcp to inspect the Python script __handler__ for event handlers,
and connect them to signals in the ui file.

**-U** __useroption__
gladevcp collects all __useroption__ strings and passes them to the handler init()
method as a list of strings without further inspection.

**-x** __XID__
Reparent gladevcp into an existing window __XID__ instead of
creating a new top level window.

**-H** __halfile__
gladevcp runs __halfile__ - a list of HAL commands - by executing __halcmd -c halfile__
after the HAL component is finalized.


**-d**
enable debug output.


**-R** __gtkrcfile__
explicitly load a gtkrc file.


**-t** __THEME__
set gtk theme. Default is __system__ theme. Different panels can have different themes.


**-m** __MAXIMUM__
force panel window to maxumize.  Together with the __-g geometry__ option 
one can move the panel to a second monitor and force it to use all of the screen


**-R**
explicitly deactivate workaround for a gtk bug which makes matches of widget and widget_class
matches in gtk theme and gtkrc files fail. Normally not needed.
