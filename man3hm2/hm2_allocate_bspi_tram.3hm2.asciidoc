hm2_allocate_bspi_tram -- Allocate the TRAM regions for a BSPI channel



===== [[syntax]]SYNTAX
hm2_allocate_bspi_tram(char* name)



===== [[description]]DESCRIPTION
**hm2_allocate_bspi_tram** Allocate the TRAM memory for bspi instance "name". 
"name" is a unique string given to each bspi channel during hostmot2 setup. 
The names of the available channels are printed to standard output during the 
driver loading process and take the form:
hm2_<board name>.<board index>.bspi.<index> For example hm2_5i23.0.bspi.0

This function allocates the TRAM memory and sets up the regular data transfers. 
It should be called only when all the frames have been defined by calls to 
hm2_tram_add_bspi_frame(). 



===== [[return value]]RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
